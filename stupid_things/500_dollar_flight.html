    <h3>TLDR</h3>
    <p>
      I paid $500 for a flight and I did not have to do that. I was very
      upset honestly. I ended up paying this money because I believe I had
      failed to plan. To me this is laziness and an attempt to rely on
      subconscious processing to accomplish the objective. The cost was deemed avoidable.

    <h3>Learnings</h3>
    <p>
      <b
        >Every single purchase requires a thorough review. If its an expensive
        purchase, it should probably require more review.</b
      >
      <p>My initial flight was hundreds of dollars. For the average American this
        could be over 1% of their take-home income for the year. 1% of what you
        make a year gone due to a mistake is pretty costly. Given the financial
        influence, it stands that this purchase deserved more review. I purchased
        this flight as most would, trying to optimize for departure and arrival
        timing and cost. However, once the flight was purchased, I failed to
        actually operate on the service I had just bought.</p>

      <b>What an emergency fund really is for.</b><p>In a strange way, this helped
        me realize the utility of an emergency fund. Supposing I didn't have the
        liquidity or breathing-room in my budget, I might have had to take money
        out of some sort of money account to fund this mistake. Hopefully, I will
        not commit this same mistake again. However, improbable (or probable)
        things happen. Maybe in the future, I am ready to leave for my flight to
        the proper airport 2 hours before and something happens with my family
        where I am no longer able to make my flight. If I didn't purchase flight
        insurance, then I will likely have to cover it somehow. If my budget we're
        tight, I might have had to dip into what is known as an "emergency fund".</p>

    <h3>Sequence of Events</h3>
    <p>
      Here's what happened. I knew I had a flight at 11AM. I had went to bed at
      4AM the previous night (or if you divide days by 24hours then the morning
      of my flight) and did very little preparation. Why I did so little I yet
      do not know. I was with a very good friend of mine at the time and I
      wanted to focus all of my time with him. I also could very reasonably say
      that I was just lazy because truthfully we were just eating pizza,
      talking, and then for the last hour scrolling through social media
      applications with the occasional "bro look at this" followed by a "damn,
      bro". I'm sure I could've done <i>some</i> preparation for my flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I woke up the next day at 9AM with texts from my airline saying the flight
      has been delayed. This bought me another hour of sleep and so I slept. I
      woke up again and got another delay notice and went back to bed. The
      flight ended up getting delayed 2 hours and I arrived at the airport
      thirty minutes before departure. Mind you, for this particular airline
      (and for most I'd imagine) gates close 20 or so minutes prior to
      departure. I was sweating, though I do do this sort of thing <i>a lot</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had already checked in online and so darted to security. The security
      agent asked me for my ID. I gave it to him. He inserted it into a black
      device. The screen in front of me said something along the lines "good to
      go" just not in those exact words. I thought nothing of it besides just
      usual airport business. The agent told me that I'd have to wait and that
      he has to insert the card again. I'm generally care-free so I thought
      nothing of it. Again, the monitor in front of me relayed the same "good to
      go" phrase. It was this second time around that my mind started humming.
      My first thought was, what a ridiculous statement. Nothing is good to go.
      The agent had to re-insert my card. I stepped past the agent with my hand
      out for my card assuming things really were good to go. After all, I had
      under 10 minutes to get to my gate. The agent stopped me and told me to
      slow down. He'd have to re-insert the card and he could only do this a
      maximum of 3 times. I asked him what was going on. He didn't respond and
      my card disappeared into that little black box that I started to develop
      an unhealthy resentment towards. I stared at the monitor for a third time.
      I shouldn't have expected that monitor to tell the truth because it had
      already lied to me twice before, but I was desparate. Again the same
      reassuring statement popped up. I knew it meant nothing. The
      agent told me that they had put in my information wrong during check-in
      and to go to my airline's frontdesk space. This confused me because I am
      the one who had done the checking in. I thought I must have messed
      something up (and boy I did which you will soon find out). I asked the
      agent where my airline's front desk was and he told me upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs was only a football's throw away and I was eager to not miss my
      flight. I dash upstairs. My airline is not listed on any of the
      direction-giving signs hanging from the ceiling. I ask another worker at
      the airport and he tells me its about a 10 minute walk in an entirely
      separate terminal. I knew this because I was dropped off that terminal
      and, for whatever particular reason, in this particular airport, I had to
      walk ten minutes to a separate terminal to reach a security point. At this
      point, I knew I had to resign any hope of making my flight and hopefully
      settle for some free, rescheduled flight. Truthfully, I had planned on
      somehow blaming my airline's systems for messing up my check-in data as
      the security agent has told me. I took my time with this walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I get to the airline frontdesk and no one is there. I walk to another
      airline's section and speak to an agent asking where my airline support
      is. He told me just he puts bags on the belt and nothing else. I
      re-asserted my statement and told him that I'd just like to talk to
      someone with my airline. He responded with what airline. I told him. He
      then told me they have no flights right now. I pulled out my boarding pass
      and essentially called him a liar. He looked at my boarding pass and his
      face drooped into a portrayal of pity. In a wierd way, enjoyed seeing the pity in his face. At the
      time, this felt validating considering the recent moments of my life. He
      then betrayed the damning news: you're at the wrong airport buddy.
      Disappointment befell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew I was in the wrong immediately. I tried to discern the odds of me
      getting a refund. In this particular case, my airline landed me at one
      airport and were going to fly me out in another airport. I hoped I'd
      receive some credit for that fact. As I was scrolling through different
      forums, I began to slowly lose any hope of getting home without having to
      pay for another flight. After all, I am the one who purchased the flight
      and the airline did, on the ticket, include what airports I'd be flying in
      and out of. I knew this mistake would cost me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without going into too much detail on the re-scheduling process, I ended up booking my flight and eating an additional
      $500.
