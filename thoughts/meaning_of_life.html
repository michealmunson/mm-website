      I'm in my latter 20s and the stuff of life has undoubtedly changed. The
      things you focus on had changed and the things that you've derived joy
      from had changed. Thinking about this a little more concretely, this is
      bound to be true, and is (or at least feels) natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider life as a baby. Your attention was on something else--as well as
      what made you happy. Your sole focus was learning to survive: how to
      acquire food, how to move around, how to stay warm, etc, and though you
      love the water now, there was a time when you were terrified of getting
      wet in a pool. That is a much different reality than when you started
      middle-school, which in turn is a much different reality than when you
      became responsible for your own taxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point in me bringing this up is that I think its important, once you
      become mentally capable to, to reflect on sourcing meaning from life.
      Douglas Adam's Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy offers the idea that the
      answer to this question is pointless. There's no answer (other than "42"
      of course).
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll start by examining what does one mean, or what do <i>I mean</i> when
      I ask what is the meaning of life? Well, if something has meaning then
      something has understand-ability. And if something has understand-ability,
      then something should or could be acted upon. So, to me, life needs
      meaning to be worth living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I don't think that life's meaning depends on one's being
      happy. One can be living life sacrificially for example and their life can
      be very meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think Douglas Adam's point holds water. There might not be an answer to
      this question and the meaning of one's life is mercurial (though probably
      not pointless).
