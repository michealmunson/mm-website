      I've recently taken up a formal position bartending. I bartend at an inn
      in the Fremont area and I mainly work Sunday evenings. The bar of the
      hotel receives light traffic, especially on Sundays, so I'm the only one
      manning the entire restaurant. My main responsibilities include making and
      serving food and drink to the hotel's overnighters. Sometimes locals will
      pop up looking for a place to relax.

      My parents bartended practically my whole life. I can recall when I was
      young sitting at my parents bar while adults enjoyed their potent potables
      and I enjoyed my own not-so-potent-for-an-adult-but-for-a-child variation.
      Working this job has given me a newfound appreciation for the trade, but
      more importantly, being born to my parents.

      My parents have always been sociable. They've always had friends and even
      in times where they have not talked to a friend in a long time (which I
      recognize happens as an adult) they've continued to demonstrate keen
      social skills.

      Excellent socializing requires a high level of intelligence. And by
      socializing, I don't mean simply interacting with other humans. I mean, as
      social animals, being able to quickly understand another person should be
      a sought-after skill. This is a cornerstone of socializing. Another
      important aspect of socializing would be being able to steer the other
      person in a way that you'd like. This of course can be used for good and
      for bad. I think a good bartender is good at both of those things.
